# SamplR

For my Ignite 2018 session on SignalR, I wanted to do something that would blend music and technology, and enable the audience to play a physical synthesizer or device. This was similar to a demo I'd done at Ignite 2015, but using more physical hardware than before, and with a more refined sound. 

You can view the demo from Ignite [here](https://youtu.be/B5A-j8et3_4?t=1826). The name was changed to **SamplR** as that felt more appropriate given the use of the [Korg Volca Sample](https://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_sample/).
